COMP4321 - Search Engine Project
============================

This project implements a web crawler and indexer that:
1. Crawls web pages using BFS starting from a seed URL
2. Perform tokenization to texts of title and body (only remove whitespace to preserve special symbols)
3. Removes stop words and applies Porter stemming
4. Indexes the content in JDBM databases
5. Supports phrase search in page titles and bodies

Build Instructions
-----------------
This project uses Maven for dependency management and building:

1. Make sure you have Java JDK 21 and Maven installed
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run: mvn clean compile

Running the Spider
-----------------
To run the spider and generate both the database and the output file:

1. Run: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="HtmlParser"

This will:
- Start the crawler from the seed URL
- Index 300 pages
- Generate the spider_index.db database file

Remarks:
- If spider_index.db is existed before running HtmlParser, the spider will read the db and check the last-modified date of fetched URLs. Updates will be performed only if page is modified.

Running the Test Program
-----------------------
To run just the test program to generate the output file from an existing database:

1. Run: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="TestProgram" -Dexec.args="spider_index"

This will:
- Read from the specified database (default is "spider_index" if not provided)
- Generate a new spider_result.txt file with the data from the database

Output Format
------------
The spider_result.txt file contains the crawled data in the following format:

Page title
URL
Last modification date, size of page
Keyword1 freq1; Keyword2 freq2; Keyword3 freq3; ... (up to 10 keywords)
Child Link1
Child Link2 ... (up to 10 child links)
---------------------------------------- (separator)
[Next page follows the same format]

Database Schema Design
---------------------
The project uses JDBM for persistent storage with the following schema:

1. Forward Indexes:
   - pageIdToUrl: Maps page IDs to their URLs
   - pageInfo: Stores page information (title, URL, last modified date, size, child links)
   - wordIdToWord: Maps word IDs to stemmed words

2. Inverted Indexes:
   - bodyInvertedIndex: Maps word IDs to lists of page IDs with frequency counts for body content
   - titleInvertedIndex: Maps word IDs to lists of page IDs with frequency counts for title content

3. Mapping Tables:
   - urlToPageId: Maps URLs to page IDs
   - wordToWordId: Maps stemmed words to word IDs

4. Phrase Search Support:
   - pageIdToBodyWords: Maps page IDs to lists of words in body (for phrase search)
   - pageIdToTitleWords: Maps page IDs to lists of words in title (for phrase search)

5. Counters:
   - counter: Stores counters for generating page IDs and word IDs

Running the Web Interface
---------------------
To use the web-based search interface:

Make sure the spider_index.db database has been generated by running the spider (see "Running the Spider" above).
Start the web server by:

1. Run: mvn jetty:run

This will:
- Launch the Jetty server and deploy the web application
- Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to access the search engine web interface
